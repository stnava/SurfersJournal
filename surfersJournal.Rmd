## September 1, 2014

Surfed avon-by-the-sea L jetty on the vanguard:  Paddled out solo at 6am, at low tide, glassy wind-swell with the wobble that comes from onshores that die to nothing.  Waist high with chest "bombs" every once in a while.  Wedgy lefts toward the L jetty and softer, longer rights.  Three peaks: (1) a right off the jetty (2) an A-frame in the middle and (3) a left further up the beach that I did not surf.  The vanguard liked the punch in these small waves, caught them well and felt good overall, fast as usual.  No problems with nose catching: bowly shape probably helped.  Five other surfers by the time I left but a mellow and friendly vibe.

This spot seems very promising at low tide on anything between east and south.  South seems like it would be better.  Swell today seemed ESE.

Picked up a used twin-fin and rode it at Loch Arbor.  The guy was obsessed with "zippi" surfboards.  Zippi, the man, is interesting: I spoke with him on the phone yesterday.  He convinced me to try his board ... Initial results in soft Loch Arbor, waist high, were mixed. Not used to riding a twin though it paddled reasonably well for a 5'7.   It feels like 2 1/4" thick with around 21" of width.  A very different board than I've ridden in the past.  Nice glide through flat sections and fast down the line ( as are twin fins ).  Decent hold - waves too weak for anything conclusive but am guessing this board was more fun in those conditions than the VG would have been.

## world tour surfers 

earliest competitive surfers i surfed with were the lopez brothers.   but we were all groms and equally unfamous.  i ran over one of their friends and put a clean, red trifin tattoo in his back.   10 years old or something.

in san sebastian spain.   surfer was pretty far down the line and i almost dropped in figuring this old dude wouldnt make it round the sections .... then looked one last time and "holy shit ... it's curren".   i didnt drop in and he made the section.   and a few more. 

gabe kling in AC - impressive backside surfing on a clean waist to chest day.

lots of guys at rocky point and pipe:   john john as a grom at pipe,  the mcnamara clan,  sunny garcia,  pancho, tom carroll, timmy curran ( at monster mush ),  flynn novak and i'm sure many more i wouldnt recognize.   sunny's a good guy to talk to like someone else on here said.   pancho was one of the guys i enjoyed watching most, in addition to carroll (90s and early 2000s).

and probably the best session was at biggish ocean beach sf trading waves with greg long .... just us in big a-frames on a sunny day
